        "all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to Me.’\n",
        "Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth.\n",
        "They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization, and sent whole nations to despair.\n",
        "Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now.\n",
        "But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.\"\"\""

            "But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.\n"
